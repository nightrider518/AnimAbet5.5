 Word game build by a beginner to Unity and C#

I hope this will eventually become a multi-player version of my word rummy game Gift Words.
For now, it simulates one player's turn actions:
1) Draw a card from the deck, or pick up a discard.
2) Add one ore more letters to any position in a previousy played word.
3) Make a new word with the cards in your hand. (Cards must be the same color, except that black letters (JKQVXZ) may be used as any color.
4) Discard a card. Each player has a sepearate discard pile.
A round ends when someone has no cards.

For a longer description, see www.518games.com/GiftWords.html

I knew nothing about Unity or C# when I started, so the app is probaby monstrously inefficient.
I hope someone more experienced can point out one thing that's easy to fix, and I'll turn that into a new version while I study some tutorials about multi-player conversion.

Thanks in advace to anyone reading this.
